@font-face is W3C&#8217;s answer to font embedding. It was introduced as a [CSS2](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html) standard but later dropped in [CSS2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html). You might remember the font embedding hype 2 or 3 years ago that just died off silently. The problem with @font-face at the time was the inconsistency of implementation across browsers, even the font type could not be agreed upon. It&#8217;s an ingenious idea none-the-less hence its new and improved self is back in force for [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-webfonts/)!<small>**</small>Nowadays it&#8217;s trendier, or should I say sexier, to show whose daddy by being most compliant rather than inventing propriety extensions to kill off the competition. A prime example is the launch of IE7, a great improvement from IE6 by the way. Weâ€™re seeing a new twist in Microsoft&#8217;s approach to browser development. No longer is it the Microsoft way that all should follow but they&#8217;re finally kneeling to the W3C god and listening to what we want! So this time round I&#8217;m adamant. When browsers do finally support @font-face again, which would probably be many years from now, it would be much closer to standard and more importantly &#8211; work! Finally could we bin the alternatives like [FIR](http://alistapart.com/articles/fir/), [sIFR](http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/) and [dynamic text replacement](http://alistapart.com/articles/dynatext) techniques.

<small>**Web fonts are still in W3C Working Draft so there&#8217;s no guarantee that @font-face will definately be back in force!</small>
