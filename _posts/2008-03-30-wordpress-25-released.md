Codenamed &#8220;Brecker&#8221;, is a milestone release with a tone of improvements.

They have totally revamped the Admin area. It looks much slicker now and the publishing process feels much more pleasant, it wasn&#8217;t even bad before! But it has improved ten-folds with more Web 2.0 goodness.

I&#8217;m especially excited about the new stuff they have added. With the Media library you can now create a gallery in any post/page using the new Shortcode API. Visitors can comment on your photos. The gallery display is a bit bland though, but I think they did this on purpose as gallery display is something the Template should handle. I can see many Lightbox2 for WordPress plugins popping up very soon!

WordPress is fast becoming a more viable CMS solution in general due to the introduction of the Media Library and a better publishing interface. The Shortcode API also gives developers ability to directly inject PHP code into content areas allowing for more sophisticated displays and embedded widget add-ons.

I haven&#8217;t talked about this before, but the Portfolio area on this site is actually a WordPress plugin. It&#8217;s a pain to manage as it uses XML for data storage and XSL to transform the data into what you see. When I get some time I hope to build a more robust Portfolio plugin leveraging WordPress&#8217; new features so I no longer have to mess around with XML, FTP and image resizing!
