Last week [Belle](http://belleliu.com), owner of [BeansBox](http://beansbox.com), invited me to join their team in the [WIF 2008 contest](http://www.webdesign-festival.com/2008/?lang=en). After reading up on [what WIF is actually about](http://www.webdesign-festival.com/2008/-About-?lang=en) I was thrilled to take up the 24 hour challenge!

This years theme was &#8220;Water Is Life&#8221; with the following selection criteria:

  * ergonomics
  * accessibility
  * interactivity
  * rich media
  * drafting
  * homogeneity
  * interaction
  * emotion
  * originality

Notice Accessibility is part of the selection criteria. This is a new criteria introduced this year. It just goes to show that in todays web, Accessibility is a necessity and not an optional after thought. I&#8217;m sure Accessibility will become one of the hottest topics of 2008.

After some brain storming with Den and Belle we found ourselves at the same level. We wanted to tell a story, educate and engage the user. What better way to engage than a Quiz, we thought? So that&#8217;s what we did! And [this is our WIF 2008 pre-selection masterpiece.](http://www.webdesign-festival.com/2008/equipes/preselections/beansbox/)

Each page of the site is sectioned into two parts. First the Quiz then the main site content. It&#8217;s structured like a charity/promotional site to raise awareness of the water crisis we face in the world today.

Admittedly the site is not without it&#8217;s flaws; namely JavaScript, CSS and images are not optimised, the Quiz is shown at the top of every page which is quite annoying; our plan was to add a cookie to remember the status of the Quiz (i.e. hide or show and current question) but time just ran out. Also the Quiz does not work in IE6 but I&#8217;m not too concerned with that one, especially as this is a contest to demonstrate what web designers can produce with current browsers.

I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved in the short space of 24 hours, at the same time trying to stay awake and not blow our brains out. Win or lose it&#8217;s an achievement in itself!

Thank you BeansBox.
