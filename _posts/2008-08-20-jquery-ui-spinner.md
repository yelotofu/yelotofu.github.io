After [contributing](http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui/browse_thread/thread/693200c6d7934b6a) [jQuery Numeric Stepper](http://yelotofu.com/2008/07/jquery-numeric-stepper/) to the jQuery UI community. [Paul Bakaus](http://paulbakaus.com/?page_id=2) kindly asked whether I&#8217;d like to merge it with the official jQuery UI Spinner, of which I was more than happy to do out of pure [love for jQuery](http://yelotofu.com/2008/02/loving-jquery/).

The jQuery UI Spinner widget will be available with the soon to be released jQuery UI v1.6.

[Here&#8217;s a demo of the current incarnation.](http://yelotofu.com/labs/jquery/UI/spinner/spinner.html)

Also, check out [Subversion](http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Subversion) if you&#8217;re interested in getting the latest and greatest.

**Update:** this spin control is currently in re-design phase and will come under intense refactoring to be leaner and meaner. So the UI team have decided to push back its release to v1.next, which means it will not be part of the final 1.6 release. Sorry guys!

**Update2:** I&#8217;ve posted an update on this [here](http://yelotofu.com/2009/05/jquery-spinner-update/).
