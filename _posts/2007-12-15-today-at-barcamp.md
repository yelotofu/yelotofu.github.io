I had a great time at the Yahoo! offices today. It was great to see such a lively crowd. Following the spirit of BarCamp this turned out to be another great event. My talk was about [7 Ways To Write &#8220;Better&#8221; HTML, +7 ways it will benefit your online business](http://yelotofu.com/presentations/barcamphk2007/), a bit of a mouthful, I know. The talk started out good and just when I was gaining confidence, [Chris Heilmann](http://wait-till-i.com) sat in on the talk! That&#8217;s when the nerves kicked in and I was mixing words not thinking straight. It&#8217;s hard not to feel inferior infront of such a knowledgable figure. Anyway, I managed to prod along and before we knew it time was up! Phew!
