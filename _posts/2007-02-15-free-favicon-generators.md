I&#8217;m sure this is probably very old school news but I&#8217;ve only recently come across this free Favicon generator tool by [DynamicDrive](http://www.dynamicdrive.com). It allows you to convert any image in either Gif, Jpeg and PNG formats, with transparency if required, into a proper icon.[http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon](http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/)

There are two more I haven&#8217;t tried yet but look good too:

[http://www.dagondesign.com/tools/favicon-generator-tool](http://www.dagondesign.com/tools/favicon-generator-tool/ "Dagon Design")  
[http://www.graphicsguru.com/favicon.php](http://www.graphicsguru.com/favicon.php "Graphics Guru")

Now there is no more excuse not to create a Favicon for your site!

Favicon away my friends!
