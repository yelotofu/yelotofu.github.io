This is my Podcast list on the topics of Web standards, Accessibility, Usability and Best practice which I&#8217;m a frequent listener:

  * [.net magazine](http://www.netmag.co.uk/zine/podcast)
  * [Boagworld](http://www.boagworld.com/podcast/index.html)
  * [Dustin Diaz](http://www.dustindiaz.com/)
  * [Web Axe](http://webaxe.blogspot.com/)
  * [WSG](http://webstandardsgroup.org/audio/)
  * [SXSW](http://feeds.feedburner.com/SXSWpodcasts)

The WSG and SXSW Podcasts are basically recordings of conference presentations, perfect for those who missed the event or live too far to trek the distance.
