The long overdue [redesign](http://jquery.com/blog/2008/08/29/jquerycom-site-redesign/) of [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com) has finally landed! I like the new design as it&#8217;s more intuitive and inline with jQuery UI&#8217;s design. This redesign will certainly help pitch jQuery to new comers; for many the decision to go with another framework has purely been based on the ugliness of the old jQuery website, that should hopefully change now.

**Old:**

**New:**

However, I still see much room for improvement. The website clearly lacks that magical touch you could easily achieve with a sprinkle of FX and UI. The fade-in boxes on the homepage don&#8217;t work for me and display erratically when you mouse over them quickly. Hopefully the jQuery team will change this soon.

That said, hats off to the team as they have done an excellent job, as always, in giving us this redesign and of course &mdash; jQuery. Thanks!
