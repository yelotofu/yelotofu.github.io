Sorry for no news these past few months. It&#8217;s been very hectic since the new family addition back in Dec which I managed to keep low key.<img src="http://localhost:8888/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> I feel so guilty now for neglecting this blog and my readers (don&#8217;t think I have any regulars anyway so I guess nothing missed!), but hey priorities are priorities!

Right, the reason for this post is that there has been some recent exciting updates to the spinner which I would love to get feedback on from the public. Thanks to <a href="http://btburnett.com/" target="_blank">Brant Burnett</a>, the Spinner has been re-invigorated and looks set to become a kick ass component in the making!

We&#8217;ve added a bunch of new features and updates including:

  * support for jquery 1.3.2
  * support for ThemeRoller
  * spinning hexidecimals and other numbering systems
  * ability to auto-hide buttons and show on hover with customizable speeds
  * better keyboard interaction &#8211; you could now use PgUp/PgDn to setup up/down in a large increment set by options

We also have a lot more in the works, such as:

  * ability to spin time and date
  * segment spinning based on formatter
  * HTML5 support
  * and more&#8230;

If interested, check out the <a href="http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/spinner/demos/index.html#spinner|default" target="_blank">latest demo</a>

We&#8217;re still in the planning / development stage so any features you see now or currently being planned may not necessarily land in the final release. It all depends on what **you** want &#8211; collectively that is! So if there is something you really think should be added please shout in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui-dev/" target="_blank">dev mailing list</a> or on the <a href="http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Spinner" target="_blank">UI planning wiki</a>.

Looking forward to some feedback.

Thanks!
