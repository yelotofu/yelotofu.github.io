Wow, it&#8217;s been [a year already](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-chrome-turns-1.html)? Time certainly flies when you&#8217;re having fun! It seems the Google Chrome team have been hard at work! They&#8217;ve finally made a version of [Google Chrome for Mac and Linux](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) which you could download from the Dev channel.

Had a quick test and found Print and Application shortcuts haven&#8217;t been implemented yet. Chrome also died on me a few times unexpectedly (doesn&#8217;t seem to cope too well with our QUnit test pages). Overall I like the minimal interface and speedier JavaScript response times. It could only get better!
