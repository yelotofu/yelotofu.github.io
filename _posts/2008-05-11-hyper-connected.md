[Jeremiah Owyang](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/about/)&#8216;s post on [Email Consumes Us](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/03/26/email-consumes-us/) gives us food for thought on the ever changing tide of communication. Email can become very unmanageable it seems; although only last year many were singing its praises saying that Email is the best invention and all good web applications basically mirror an Email architecture. So if Email is no longer a viable solution in this hyper-connected world, what is? Is [The Grid](http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/03/42230) our only hope?

For those who have not heard, The Grid is a [superfast internet](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3689881.ece) 10,000 times faster than current broadband speeds. 

The Grid could spawn a whole new generation of web applications and facilitate a new way of communicating in the future bringing death to the humble Email.
