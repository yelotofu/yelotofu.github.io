I&#8217;m sure no one noticed but Yelotofu got naked for about 1 hour today because the CSS Naked Day plugin I had installed last year thought today was the day to strip off!

Well, this years&#8217; CSS Naked Day will be held on the 9th of April. This time Yelotofu will be getting butt naked for 48 hours!

Come on, [Join in the fun!](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/)
