Today marks the release of jQuery UI <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1.6</span> 1.7. Kudos to UI team members who&#8217;ve done a fantastic job!

I&#8217;m pretty excited not only because I&#8217;m now part of this fantastic [team](http://jqueryui.com/about) but also with where UI is [headed](http://jqueryui.pbwiki.com/) and how it has progressed thus far. UI is still pretty young compared to other UI libraries so there is much to learn from the likes of Dojo, ExtJS and YUI &#8211; all great frameworks in their own right.

1.7 see&#8217;s a total refactor of the [UI CSS Framework](http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/API) and [ThemeRoller v2](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/). This must be by far the greatest visible improvement in this version of UI. Though it is but one part of the hard work put into this release.

For full details on this release see the [official release announcement](http://blog.jqueryui.com/2009/03/jquery-ui-17/).
