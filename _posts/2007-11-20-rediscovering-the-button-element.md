I recently came across an article on [particletree.com](http://particletree.com) about [rediscovering the button element](http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/). This article takes you through an example of how the `button` element was used to deliver buttons that look exactly the same across all major browsers, including Safari 2. If you&#8217;re still using the `input` element for buttons then I&#8217;d recommend reading this article. To say the least, the `button` element has better semantics and is just as well, if not better, supported by all major browsers!
