I have been doing <span class="caps">Ajax</span> in minute proportions over the months but haven&#8217;t really got down to mastering the art. I don&#8217;t consider myself an <span class="caps">Ajax</span> expert but I get dis-heartened with often seeing the spaghetti code of supposedly AJAX professionals, making it virtually impossible to update their code without breaking something.At the moment I&#8217;m reading [<span class="caps">Ajax</span> in Action](http://www.manning.com/crane/) by Dave Crane _et al_. I&#8217;d recommend it to all spiring Ajaxians as it demonstrates how to code in a non-spaghetti style by employing Design Patterns. I&#8217;m only on Chapter 3 but it&#8217;s looking good so far.
