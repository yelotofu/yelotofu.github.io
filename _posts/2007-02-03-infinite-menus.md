After having so much fun with [my drop down menus](http://yelotofu.com/2007/01/css-drop-down-menus/) I did a search on the Web to see what others had to offer. I came across Infinite Menus by [OpenCube](http://www.opencube.com). They have an impressive offering; 100% pure CSS driven and accessible with JavaScript used only for spicing things up, a visual interface for customizations and re-skinning, tonnes of transition effects and menu types. The only snag is it comes with a price tag, but who wouldn&#8217;t with what they have!Now, there&#8217;s a long and arduous road ahead for my humble drop downs.
