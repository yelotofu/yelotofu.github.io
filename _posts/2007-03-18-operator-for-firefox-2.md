[Operator](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4106/) is a Microformats detection toolbar for Firefox 2. The toolbar makes developing and using microformats much easier and more intuitive. You could export hCard data on any Microformatted page to standard vCard format by selecting it in the toolbar, no copy & paste necessary. And hCalendars could be exported in a similar fashion to your favourite calendar package. Here&#8217;s a good [introductory piece on Operator](http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2006/12/16/microformats-part-3-introducing-operator/) by Alex Faaborg, a User Experience Designer working on [Firefox 3](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3).Microformats are growning in prominence and the Mozilla team is hot on it&#8217;s tail. Most of the functionality you see in Operator now is likely to be part of the Firefox 3 core!
