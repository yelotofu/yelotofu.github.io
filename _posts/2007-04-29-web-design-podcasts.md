Boagworld have a [Web design podcasts directory](http://www.boagworld.com/archives/2005/10/web_design_podcasts_directory.html) which looks very good. It includes most of my current playlist and much much more. You should go check it out, make sure to read the comments too as I have no doubt you&#8217;d find some hidden gems there.I&#8217;m totally hooked on podcasts, it&#8217;s a really easy way of keeping up with the latest trends in Web design.
