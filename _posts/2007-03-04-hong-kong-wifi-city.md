The Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, Henry Tang, announced his 2007-08 Budget last week. He stated that due to Hong Kong&#8217;s economic growth and excess revenue amounted from previous years the Government is adding measures to give back to its people, one of which is to invest HK$210 million (GBP 13.8 million) to provide free Wi-Fi access in public libraries, parks and government venues. There are about 1,000 free hotspots in HK currently and it&#8217;s estimated that with this new investment it will increase to about 3,000!** On top of this Hong Kong has no shortage of premium serviced and non-government hotspots such as those you get at Starbucks and Pacific Coffee. Additionally PCCW launched its free Wi-Fi service at Chek Lap Kok Airport a.k.a. Hong Kong Int. Airport earlier this year with 100% coverage of the terminal.Soon, a Wi-Fi hotspot will never be more than a short walk away_, Work from home_ would soon mean _Work from Anywhere_ to me!

Time to find a comfy hotspot! Hotspot hunting here I come!
