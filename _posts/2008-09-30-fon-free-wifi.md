I&#8217;m sure you will agree this is nothing new but I&#8217;ve been intrigued by the FON Free WiFi service for quite some time, just never got round to sharing my thoughts.

With the recent horror stories about [wireless mobile subscribers racking up thousands of dollars in mobile data charges](http://www.wftv.com/money/17390103/detail.html) I thought I&#8217;d finally blog a bit about FON.

Martin Varsavsky founded FON on February 2006 in Madrid, Spain. <cite><a href="http://blog.fon.com/en/archive/foneros/fon-wifi-community-welcomes-1000000th-member.html">FON’s mission is to stimulate the growth of WiFi around the world by creating a global Community of “Foneros”.</a></cite> FON is the largest WiFi community and recently reached 1 million members this September. 

FON&#8217;s goal is to provide Free WiFi access everywhere. To do this they had the idea that to receive you must first give &mdash; plant a small mustard seed and receive 10, 20 and 100 folds.

When I first heard about FON, the concept of opening my WiFi to public was a bit scary. For starters you&#8217;re asking for trouble because it involves sharing on an unencrypted channel, leaving you vulnerable to malicous attacks. However, I later discovered to share a connection with FON you need their Fonero router. This router has two APs built-in, one for personal use (encrypted via WPA) and the other open to public (unencrypted). It was instant buy-in for me after that.<img src="http://localhost:8888/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

The potential for FON is huge, especially in a small city like Hong Kong. WiFi mobility is a key step towards the evolution of the Internet. To move from stationary workstations to mobile on-the-go always-on access the public needs affordable, available and reliable access with good coverage. FON might just have the right sort of ecosystem to provide for Hong Kong.
