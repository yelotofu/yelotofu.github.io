Wohoo! OK, maybe not as big as Chrome but [Django 1.0 released](http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2008/sep/03/1/) yesterday! Django is a brilliant Python Web framework designed to make our lives easier. Django takes DRY to its extreme and comes with myraids of [documentation](http://docs.djangoproject.com) including an [online book](http://djangobook.com/)! Django is like Lego, first you start with many dispersed pieces; you then get an idea of what you want to build; pick up a few pieces from [Django Plugables](http://djangoplugables.com/); and tada! Your masterpiece is near completion.

I know I sound like a salesman now but I&#8217;m really just trying to express my excitment to the 1.0 release<img src="http://localhost:8888/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

Now, it&#8217;s time to get my hands dirty with Python!
