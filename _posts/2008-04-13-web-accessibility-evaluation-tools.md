[WebAIM](http://www.webaim.org/) recently released the [WAVE Toolbar](http://wave.webaim.org/toolbar) for Firefox, which augments their free online accessbility evaluation service, known as [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/). WAVE is currently in version 4, much like [Cynthia Says](http://www.contentquality.com/) but with a focus on developer friendliness by overlaying results visually above the page you are testing. I think WAVE is a pretty cool idea. The fact of the matter that no automated tool can ever tell whether a website is truly accessible means it always boils down to human assessment in the end. So a visual tool is much welcomed as the explanations you get from Cynthia are quite cryptic at times.

For more power in your toolbar I recommend trying out the [Firefox Accessibility Extension.](http://firefox.cita.uiuc.edu/) This one is primarily an assistive tool for people with disabilities browsing the Web but also doubles up as a great accessibility evaluation tool for developers.
