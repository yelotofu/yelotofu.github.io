Recently, I&#8217;ve been having fun creating pure* CSS drop down menus for Lemon, see: <a href="http://yelotofu.com/demo/css_menu/" target="_blank">example 1</a>, <a href="http://yelotofu.com/demo/css_menu2/" target="_blank">example 2</a> . These things really get the brain juices going. These menus are fully Accessible and supports IE6, IE7, Firefox, Flock, Opera, Netscape 8 and Safari. I&#8217;m going to keep at improving the code to make it re-usable, re-skinable with more browser support!I will release this to the open source community when I feel it&#8217;s ready to withstand scrutiny. It also depends on whether there&#8217;s enough interest! Time will tell&#8230;

<small>*IE6 browsers require JS intervention due to the lack of support for the CSS <strong>:hover</strong> pseudo-class on LI elements.</small>
