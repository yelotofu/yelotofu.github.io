There are two Rails-like PHP frameworks gaining momentum and amounting a zealous following, both of which have recently gone stable.[Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.com) and [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org), written in pure PHP follow the same MVC (Model, View, Constroller) architecture found on Rails. They&#8217;ve gone at lengths to make it easy and intuitive to use and provide scaffolding tools, buit-in AJAX support and I18n support. The good news for PHP developers is that you only need to learn a new framework not a whole new language! Believe me, I&#8217;ve been there and done that. At one point I was learning Ruby on Rails, I&#8217;ve even got [**the** book](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html) to prove it! I&#8217;d love to start learning it again though, but as with all things, free time is a priviledge I do not have.

Last but not least, there is the [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/). Though it&#8217;s still in preview release it&#8217;s set to become the best PHP framework of all time and will change the way we PHP developers build web applications. From what I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s aimed at being Rails-like too and requires PHP 5. It promises to be all things and cater for everyone. I&#8217;ve got my eyes set on this one!
