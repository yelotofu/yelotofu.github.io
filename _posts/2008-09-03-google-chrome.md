As you may have heard Google Chrome (Chrome) went [live](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/google-chrome-now-live.html) yesterday. The Chrome team also released a [comic](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html) explaining some of the innovations and ideas around Chrome.

After installing Chrome the first impression I got was it&#8217;s a very slim-line and compact browser. The UI reflects this totally. There isn&#8217;t the usual File menu above (personally I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s needed in a browser anyway) and tabbing is at the very top. The [Omnibox](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95440&hl=en), Chrome&#8217;s address bar, is very dominant and a very powerful. Much like Vista start search feature you don&#8217;t have to remember where things are &mdash; just search for it. The default search engine of the Omnibox does not have to be Google either, use &#8220;Options -> Basics -> Default search&#8221; to change it.

I really like the [Application shortcuts](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95710&hl=en) feature. Many a time I have wanted a shortcut on my desktop which opens up a web application much like a desktop app does. I know you could create a lnk file and place that on the deskopt but somehow it doesn&#8217;t feel good. When you create an application shortcut however it creates for you a special shortcut which opens up Chrome in an even slimmer interface that looks just like a standard desktop application. It is excellent when used in twine with GMail.

Chrome is a muti-threaded browser, that means each instance (new tab, new window, plugin, javascript etc) runs a separate process, it sounds like a wasteful approach but quite a fascinating concept as explained in the [comic](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html). It uses the tried and tested [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) engine for rendering web pages and the [V8](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) JavaScript engine. V8 is a high performance engine written in C++ which compiles and executes JavaScript code. All are open source projects so not an inch of propreitary code inside!

I think Google is on to a winner, if not, they have once again set the bar higher for others to compete against.
