I recently came across two very interesting CSS websites, [CSSplay](http://cssplay.co.uk) and [CSS3.info](http://www.css3.info/)CSSplay is totally amazing, it&#8217;s a real eye opener on what could be achieved with pure CSS madness. It contains useful implementations of CSS2 rounded corners, drop down menus, CSS image gallery and even drawing with CSS!

CSS3.info on the other hand is not so fun but definitely very handy to have as a developers resource for the up and coming CSS3 standard. It&#8217;s ready and loaded with goodies that &#8220;will work&#8221; as and when browsers support features. It really beats having to read through uninspiring and long-winded W3C papers to get to the juice.
