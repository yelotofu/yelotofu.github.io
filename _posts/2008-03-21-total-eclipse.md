As a generalist I usually have to open multiple applications just to get work done; Dreamweaver, Flash, Fireworks/Image Ready, VS2005 and all major browsers are but a few apps in my developer toolbox I use frequently. Having multiple desktop applications open at the same time makes ctrl-tabbing frustratingâ€”killing productivity. Development tools are usually very memory intensive too, so the more you have open the slower your system gets.

I love [the Eclipse platform](http://www.eclipse.org) and the way you could extend core functionality via plugins. For several months now I have been using the Apatana plugin for Eclipse which adds better support for CSS, (X)HTML, JavaScript and a few of the latest platforms such as Adobe AIR and iPhone.

Eclipse is platform independent as it&#8217;s built on the Java Runtime environment. So theoretically if you have a team of developers with different OS taste you could even share project settings.

I&#8217;m currently running [Eclipse IDE 3.3](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) with the following plugins:

  * [The Aptana plugin](http://www.aptana.com/)
  * [Aptana Radrails](http://www.aptana.com/rails)
  * [Subclipse](http://subclipse.tigris.org/)
  * [Adobe Flex Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/)
  * [PDT](http://www.zend.com/en/community/pdt) (PHP Development Tools)
  * [WST](http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/) (Web Standard Tools)

I don&#8217;t ctrl+tab as much now but Eclipse does get pretty sluggish at times, which could be a downer if you have a slow system.
