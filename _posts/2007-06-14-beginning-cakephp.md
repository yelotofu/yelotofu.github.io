I&#8217;m finally taking the plunge into CakePHP. The Rails-like Rapid Development architecture has allured me for some time.Ã‚ However, on starting I immediately came across trivial questions such as how do I create static pages? how do I create an Admin area? how do I send HTML emails? etc etc&#8230; I stumbled upon the [21 things I learned about CakePHP](http://www.avatarfinancial.com/pages/cake/) article which quickly answered all my newbie questions. A real time saver!
