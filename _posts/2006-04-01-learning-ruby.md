For a recent project I had to learn RoR (<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>). After looking into this whole new arena to web development I am very impressed by its rapid web development framework. Honestly, you can quickly create a prototype application in just a few lines of code!

Here are a few resources I found useful whilst learning Ruby:

  * Check out <a href="http://www.radrails.org/" target="_blank">radrails</a>. A cross-platform IDE for developing Rails projects
  * <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Tortoise SVN</a>. A Subversion for Windows. Radrails integrates very well with this.
  * <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Howtos" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails HowTos</a>. Quick and dirty guides on common problems/tasks.
  * <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/" target="_blank">Ruby-Docs</a>. For those who want to know everything about Ruby!

To get on the bandwagon decided to get a book to kick start the learning. A quick search on Amazon landed me on &#8220;Pragmatic Programmers &#8211; Programming Ruby, 2nd Ed&#8221;. Apparently this is <span style="font-weight: bold">THE</span> definitive book! A must have! I only recently moved to Hong Kong. It&#8217;s a great city. It has everything a modern citizen would need from good food to endless entertainment&#8230; <span style="font-weight: bold">BUT</span>&#8230; I could not seem to find a single good English bookstore!!! I&#8217;d admit, I haven&#8217;t been here long enough to assert the above statement as true. Though I&#8217;m going to the <a href="http://www.pageonegroup.com/" target="_blank">Page One store</a> in Festival Walk tomorrow to find out.

In the UK there is no shortage of good bookstores. We even take them for granted, sometimes, turning them into caf√©s and tourist attractions.
