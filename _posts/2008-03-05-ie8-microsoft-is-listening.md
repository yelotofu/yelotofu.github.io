Wow, [Microsoft actually listened](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx) to the out pour of the developer community with regards to IE8&#8242;s version targeting feature. IE8&#8242;s Standards Mode will now be the default:

<blockquote cite="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx">
  <p>
    In light of the Interoperability Principles, as well as feedback from the community, we’re choosing differently. Now, IE8 will show pages requesting &#8220;Standards&#8221; mode in IE8’s Standards mode. Developers who want their pages shown using IE8’s “IE7 Standards mode” will need to request that explicitly.

Thank you Microsoft!
